# data-mining-project-2025
This repository contains the complete implementation of a data mining project conducted as part of the 2024 course curriculum. The goal of this project is to demonstrate an end-to-end data science pipeline, including preprocessing, classification, and unsupervised analysis. The project uses a unique dataset obtained from info.data.gov.il.

## Objectives
Build a comprehensive classification pipeline:
Data preprocessing.
Feature engineering.
Model training, evaluation, and interpretation.
Perform unsupervised analysis:
Clustering.
Anomaly detection or recommendation system.

## Dataset
Source: info.data.gov.il
Description: The dataset contains information about bonds, including issuance details, maturity terms, coupon rates, prices, and quantities.
Key Features:
BONDS: The type of bond (target for classification).
COUPON: Coupon rate.
PURCHASEDQUANTITY: Quantity purchased.
AVERAGEPRICE and CUTOFFPRICE: Price indicators.
ACTUALTERMTOMATURITY: Actual time to maturity.
